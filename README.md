## 📌 Why This Portfolio Stands Out

This portfolio demonstrates:

- **Time-series modeling** (NASA, M5, Gait)  
- **Applied machine learning** (housing, recommender systems)  
- **Modern NLP** (BERT, embeddings, topic modeling)  
- **Optimization & algorithms** (genetic algorithms)  
- **ML systems & deployment** (FastAPI, Streamlit, Docker)

It reflects real-world, end-to-end machine learning — from raw data to deployed models.
